### Project description

The customers of this project are IT-Agency and the online beauty store [New Beauty Box](https://newbeautybox.ru/) 

The main goals of this project are:

To link the orders to their sources, implementing SQL scripts.
To build dashboards on the received data in Power BI for three stakeholders: the advertising vendor, the marketing director, and the CEO.

### SQL Scripts

Via the links below, you can see how I extracted data for the dashboards, utilizing SQL for:

* [Advertising vendor](https://github.com/aaallexandr/freelance-projects/blob/main/Marketing%20dashboard%20for%20IT-Agency/ad_vendor_data.sql)
* [Marketing director](https://github.com/aaallexandr/freelance-projects/blob/main/Marketing%20dashboard%20for%20IT-Agency/markdir_ceo_data.sql)

### Dashboards

#### Dashboard for Advertising Vendor

The dashboard for the advertising vendor provides direct advertising data such as marketing spends, impressions, clicks, CTR, and conversion to orders.

#### Dashbord for marketing director

The dashboard for the marketing director is the most detailed in data. It represents key marketing information:

* Distribution of order statuses and sources of attribution.
* Conversions to payment and order cancellation.
* Revenue, spends, profit, and ROMI dynamics.
* Orders funnel.
* Average check and customer acquisition cost (CAC).
